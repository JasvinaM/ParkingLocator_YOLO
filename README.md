# ParkingLocator

#### Parking Locator is a program that detects spaces for users by scanning video file of a parking lot to determine the number of cars in the parking lot.

#### It is suitable for locations where parking spaces are not readily allocated such as shopping malls. 
#### For this program, the focus area is to detect parking spaces in parking lots for residential areas that do not have parking spaces specifically allocated for residents.
